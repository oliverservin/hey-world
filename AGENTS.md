# AGENTS.md

## Repository Overview
This repo contains personal blog posts in Markdown format under `/posts`. There is no source code, build, lint, or test system.

## Guidelines for Agents
1. **File Structure**: All posts go in `/posts` as `.md` files. Do not add code files unless requested.
2. **Markdown Formatting**:
   - Use clear headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
   - Prefer bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
   - Use code blocks for code snippets
   - Keep line length < 100 chars for readability
3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Post filenames: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `my-first-post.md`)
   - Use descriptive, concise titles in posts
4. **Imports/Links**:
   - Use relative links for internal references
   - External links should be valid and descriptive
5. **Types**: Not applicable (Markdown only)
6. **Error Handling**:
   - If a post is missing or malformed, notify the user
   - Do not delete or overwrite posts without explicit instruction
7. **Formatting**:
   - Use consistent spacing and indentation
   - Avoid trailing whitespace
8. **General Style**:
   - Write in a clear, friendly, and professional tone
   - Proofread for grammar and spelling
9. **No Build/Lint/Test Commands**: This repo does not use code or tests
10. **No Cursor/Copilot Rules**: No special agentic or AI rules present
