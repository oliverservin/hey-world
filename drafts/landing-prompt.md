# Preparation

## Why am I writing this?

I'm writing it because marketing is a challenge for me. As a developer, I struggle to sell anything to anyone. However, since I'm starting a portfolio of SaaS products, I need to learn how to sell my products. A crucial part of any marketing strategy for selling SaaS products is writing a compelling landing page. This document outlines my process for creating a landing page for one of my SaaS products.

## What audience is it for?

This writing is for developers who share my struggle with writing effective marketing copy.

## How it's distinctive?

It's distinctive because most copywriting material found on the internet is not created for developers. We typically have a different perspective on how to do things, often utilizing tools that assist us in this process.

## Developer Struggles with Marketing

Now that I'm working on a portfolio of products, building them is not my main struggle since I'm a web developer. Instead, I find it challenging to act as a salesperson, trying to sell a product and write marketing copy.

## Seeking Help: The Stripe Guide

The first thing I considered was getting some help. After a quick search, I found an article on Stripe that provides a guide on writing landing pages [Add link to the guide]. I read the entire article, and it made sense to me.

## Using Language Models to Assist

The first step I took was to use language models to create a prompt based on the guide to help me write a landing page. This approach is similar to how I use language models to assist me in writing code for building products, but this time, I aimed to create effective landing page copy.

I provided a language model with the URL to read and asked it to generate a prompt for writing landing pages based on the article.

## Required Inputs for the Prompt

However, using this prompt requires me to provide eight things, as it's based on the Stripe guide:

- Product/service name
- What it does
- Target audience
- Main benefit(s)
- Objections or hesitations customers might have
- Market maturity (new/emerging or established/mature)
- Stage of customer awareness
- Any proof, data, or testimonials

Besides the product name and what it does, I didn't have anything else. This is probably my oversight, except for the testimonials part. I should have done some research to cover the other aspects, probably even before building my product, which I didn't.

## Writing the Initial Draft

So, I wrote a draft outlining the purpose of the product, the problem it solves, and how it works.

## Filling in the Gaps with Language Models

Now that my draft is written, I could use language models again to help me address the missing parts required for the prompt to write my landing page copy.

### What the Product Does

The first task was to ask the language model to identify, in its own words, what the product does.

It did a great job summarizing what my product does with minimal refinement.

### Identifying the Target Audience

Next, I asked it to think about the target audience. It effectively identified the main target audience as newsletter creators and publishers.

### Summarizing Main Benefits

The next step was to describe the main benefits of my product. The model summarized my product's benefits like a salesperson, highlighting eight key advantages.

[Generated benefits]

### Handling Objections

Next, I focused on objection-handling statements, which are legitimate doubts that potential customers might have. The language model generated ten main objection-handling statement topics.

[Generated objection-handling statements]

Since I was still hesitant to address those statements, I asked the language model to generate responses to each objection.

### Assessing Market Maturity

The next task was to determine the market maturity, meaning whether the product market is new or emerging. Personally, I didn't know how to assess this; it's probably something a good marketer would do. I should learn more about how to evaluate it.

Asking the language model to determine the market maturity provided a quick fix for my lack of knowledge for now.

## Generating the Final Landing Page Copy

That was the last point. Now I could use my prompt to ask the language model to generate my landing page copy with all the input for my product.

The resulting draft looked great to me. I could tell it generated a strong copy that I could use to design a landing page based on it. I made a few manual changes to adjust it to my taste, but overall, the changes were minimal.

## Reflections on the Process

The language model really helped me gain a better understanding of the market my product is entering and the possible target audiences. The prompt was effective in generating a draft for a landing page that I later used to design a landing page for my product.

It's astonishing that language models can assist us with this work. I would have needed to invest a significant amount of time in market research or hire a professional landing page copywriter.

Using language models as a tool, just like I do to help write code, for areas outside my expertise has really helped me cover my knowledge gaps in those areas, and it might help you too.
